                    <h2 id="backstory">Heritage & Backstory</h2>
                    <p>Jin Sakai grew up in Omi Village, Tsushima Island. 
                        Growing up in the ruling class of samurai, he was 
                        raised in a strict, disciplined environment, trained 
                        by his father, Kazumasa Sakai, and uncle, Lord Shimura, 
                        to become a samurai. During his youth, he was friends with 
                        Ryuzo, and taken care of by his maid, Yuriko. When his father 
                        was murdered while Jin was still an adolescent, his uncle, 
                        Lord Shimura, jito (a land steward appointed by the shogunate) 
                        of Tsushima island, took Jin as his ward and continued to train 
                        Jin in the way of the samurai.</p>

                    <p>The Mongols manage to conquer Tsushima in a grand battle, causing the disruption of the samurai.
                        Throughout the story, Jin goes on to attack Castle Kaneda, liberating the Izuhara region, 
                        which in turn led to the rescue of his uncle, Lord Shimure, and later he secures Castle 
                        Kaneda through brutal means. Due to this, Jin is cast out and labelled as a threat to 
                        the honor code of the samurai, and he is now hunted down by Mongols and samurai alike. After 
                        claiming Castle Shimura, the second region, Toyotama, is liberated. It can be assumed that Jin 
                        goes on to liberate the last region, Kamiagata, as well since I haven't actually finished the 
                        game.

                    <h3>Sakai Katana and Tanto</h3>
                    <img src="Katana_The_Storm_of_Clan_Sakai.png">
                    <p>The sword of clan Sakai, passed on through many generations. It is stated to have "saved lives
                         and ended wars." The Sakai sword is a sharp, reliable blade capable of slicing through flesh 
                        and bone easily, but also seems to have a easy time slicing through armor as well, making it 
                        a dangerous weapon you won't want to be on the sharp end of. A tanto is shorter version of 
                        the Sakai katana, often imployed during assassinations, or when cutting hostages free. A 
                        tanto is similar to a knife in its usage, and is not traditionally used in head-on combat.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ghost Weapons</h3>
                    <p>Due to the dire circumstances, Jin had to adapt in order to fight his enemy, learning the ways of 
                        assassination, as well as how to use weapons like the infamous kunai, smoke bombs, sticky bombs, 
                        firecrackers and wind chimes, and even a poison blowdart, which could either make his enemies 
                        hallucinate, attacking their own comrades, or cause them to cough up their own blood and die 
                        and slow, painful death.
